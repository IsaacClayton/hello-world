# hello-world
This is the first programming assignment for COP 3330
My name is Isaac Clayton and I am a sohpomore at UCF. This is my second programming class and I plan to do everything I can to get an A in this class, as well as understand it fully so I can take this information out into the real world when I am looking for a job.
